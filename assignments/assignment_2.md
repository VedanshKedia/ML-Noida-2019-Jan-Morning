## Task 1 (Regression)
 * Can we break down regression problem into classification by graining out data. (Why and why not)
 * Google search - linear, ridge and lasso regression
 * Search when and how to use KNN as regression model.
 * Find proof of why all ML problems can be broken down into KNN model.

## Task 2 (K-Means)
 * Apply KMeans clustering algorithm to devide colleges data provided into 2 categories. (Private vs Public Institutions)
 * Data is located [here](College.csv)
 * Observations on the following 18 variables.
    - Private A factor with levels No and Yes indicating private or public university
    - Apps Number of applications received
    - Accept Number of applications accepted
    - Enroll Number of new students enrolled
    - Top10perc Pct. new students from top 10% of H.S. class
    - Top25perc Pct. new students from top 25% of H.S. class
    - F.Undergrad Number of fulltime undergraduates
    - P.Undergrad Number of parttime undergraduates
    - Outstate Out-of-state tuition
    - Room.Board Room and board costs
    - Books Estimated book costs
    - Personal Estimated personal spending
    - PhD Pct. of faculty with Ph.D.â€™s
    - Terminal Pct. of faculty with terminal degree
    - S.F.Ratio Student/faculty ratio
    - perc.alumni Pct. alumni who donate
    - Expend Instructional expenditure per student
    - Grad.Rate Graduation rate

## Task 2 (Online quiz)
 * Complete quiz based on KNN at online.codingblocks.com course assigned to you.

## Bonus task
 * Try K-Means observation above with diffrent subsets of features and list down accuracy deviations.
 * Can we somehow make K-Means to depned of feature weights.
 * Note down observations (which fields are more important and should have been given more weight).
